  This Project solution results to a feasibility for the administrator/Instructor to a particular class to track all the newly joined students who logged into the systems of Computer Science Department or the University systems with an associated Student id and a generated unique number which is a randomly generated 5 digits of Unique Number associated to username of the Student. In our case associated pair will be Foo**** ID and a 5 digit unique number which will be created at the first login of a student. 
                  Project Title
  Random Unique Number generation for new Students in Concordia University Wisconsin Computers environment 
    For example:- 
        Consider a student newly entered the university. Student will be given with credentials to login into the university computers by creating student’s username and password account to the network users Active Directory Groups listings (AD groups). 
Without login into the university network systems, student will not be provided with a drive to store their data which is M drive in network. When a student login into the computer with credentials at first time, after the successful login it will take couple of minutes to create a personal space for the user and loads the desktop. 
  
  The requirement of this task is to create a text file with randomly generated unique number which is associated with the student and storing this text file. 
•	For viewing to the user in a location within the assigned M drive space. 
•	Keeping the associated random unique number according to student for the administrator for usage in tracking and business purposes.
